# libpixyusb - Standalone Pixy Camera libray in C

This is a fork of the [code surrounding the pixy camera](https://github.com/charmedlabs/pixy).

We removed everthing but the pixusb library and the hello_pixy test program. We also included the multiple camera support addition from the [NURobotics fork](https://github.com/NURobotics/pixy).
